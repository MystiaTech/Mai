# 🤖 Mai Project Progress Report

**Date:** January 27, 2026 | **Status:** 🔥 Actively in Development | **Milestone:** v1.0 Core Foundation

---

## ✨ What is Mai?

Mai is an **autonomous conversational AI agent** that doesn't just chat — **she improves herself**. She's a genuinely intelligent companion with a distinct personality, real memory, and agency. She analyzes her own code, proposes improvements, and auto-applies changes for review.

Think of her as an AI that *actually* learns and grows, not one that resets every conversation.

### 🎯 The Vision
- **🏠 Runs entirely local** — No cloud, no corporate servers, no Big Tech listening in
- **📚 Learns and improves** — Gets smarter from your interactions over time
- **🎭 Has real personality** — Distinct values, opinions, boundaries, and authentic growth
- **📱 Works everywhere** — Desktop, mobile, fully offline with graceful fallbacks
- **🔄 Syncs seamlessly** — Continuity across all your devices

---

## 🚀 Development Status

### Phase 1: Model Interface & Switching — PLANNING COMPLETE ✅
**Status:** Ready to execute | **Timeline:** This month

This is where Mai gets **brains**. We're building the foundation for her to:
- 🧠 Connect to LM Studio for lightning-fast local model inference
- 🔍 Auto-detect what models you have available
- ⚡ Intelligently switch between models based on the task *and* what your hardware can handle
- 💬 Manage conversation context efficiently (keeping memory lean without losing context)

**What ships with Phase 1:**
1. **LM Studio Connector** → Connect and list your local models
2. **System Resource Monitor** → Real-time CPU, RAM, GPU tracking
3. **Model Configuration Engine** → Profiles with resource requirements and fallback chains
4. **Smart Model Switching** → Silently pick the best model for the job

## 🗺️ The Full Roadmap — 15 Phases of Awesome

### v1.0 Core (The Brain) 🧠
*Foundation systems: Local models, safety, memory, and conversation*

1️⃣ **Model Interface & Switching** ← We are here
2️⃣ **Safety & Sandboxing**
3️⃣ **Resource Management**
4️⃣ **Memory & Context Management**
5️⃣ **Conversation Engine**

### v1.1 Interfaces & Intelligence (The Agency) 💪
*She talks back, improves herself, and has opinions*

6️⃣ **CLI Interface**
7️⃣ **Self-Improvement System**
8️⃣ **Approval Workflow**
9️⃣ **Personality System**
🔟 **Discord Interface** ← She'll hang out with you here!

### v1.2 Presence & Mobile (The Presence) ✨
*Visual, voice, and everywhere you go*

1️⃣1️⃣ **Offline Operations**
1️⃣2️⃣ **Voice Visualization**
1️⃣3️⃣ **Desktop Avatar**
1️⃣4️⃣ **Android App**
1️⃣5️⃣ **Device Synchronization**

## 💥 Why This Matters

### The Problem with Current AI
❌ **Static** — Same responses every time, doesn't actually learn
❌ **Forgetful** — You have to re-explain everything each conversation
❌ **Soulless** — Feels like talking to a corporate database
❌ **Watched** — Always pinging servers, always recording
❌ **Stuck** — Can't improve or evolve, just runs the same code forever

### What Makes Mai Different
✅ **Genuinely learns** — Long-term memory that evolves into personality layers
✅ **Truly offline** — Everything happens on *your* machine. No cloud. No spying.
✅ **Real personality** — Distinct values, opinions, boundaries, and authentic growth
✅ **Self-improving** — Analyzes her own code, proposes improvements, auto-applies safe changes
✅ **Everywhere** — Desktop avatar, voice visualization, native mobile app, full sync
✅ **Safely autonomous** — Second-agent review system = no broken modifications

**The difference:** Mai doesn't just chat. She *remembers*, *grows*, and *improves herself over time*. She's a real collaborator, not a tool.
